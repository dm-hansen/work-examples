I used machine learning to develop an enrollment prediction system for
George Fox University. The work was published in Strategic Enrollment
Quarterly (see PDF).

The bulk of the work is in extracting data from the university's
PeopleSoft datbase and augmenting that with US Census data; the actual
machine learning is farily straightforward using the FANN toolkit that I
have used previously in my AI course.
