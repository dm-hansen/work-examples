To pull all historical data for a year and generate predictions:

   $ getAllAndPredictForYear <YEAR>

Other scripts can be used to regenerate all or parts of the data:

   getHistoryForYear <YEAR> 
      called by getAllForYear to get the historical data for the year which fetches data and 
      builds models

   getDataAndPredict <YEAR>
      called by getAllForYear to get the current year's data and run
      predictions

   getPredictYearData <YEAR>
      used by getAndPredict to pull data for predictions

   predictYear <YEAR>
      used by getAndPrecict to generate predictions

   getAll
      starts at 2010 and pulls 5-year data sets, generates models and
      predictions (i.e., it performs the getAllForYear for all years
      from 2010 on)
