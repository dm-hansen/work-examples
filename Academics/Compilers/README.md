This course includes a project to develop a working compiler, initially by 
hand, for a simple Turning-complete programming language. Students are
free to choose their language of implementation. The project originally
used the JVM as the target "machine" but has recently been retargetted 
to ARM; the compiler presented here targets the JVM and demonstrates an
OOP approach to building a recursive-descent compiler. 

I also show an implementation of the compiler that is built using
JavaCC, one that compiles to the JVM and another that compiles to ARM
assembly
