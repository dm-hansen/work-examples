These programs are solutions to programming assignments given to
students in various courses including Data Structres, Algorithms,
Compilers, Operating Systems, etc.

In some instances these programs are provided to students after the
assignment to demonstrate an approach and foster discussion. In other
instances the programs are merely my solutions to an interesting
assignment such as the genetic Inver-Over algorithm for approximating a
solution to the TSP.

These programs are intended to give a sense of my general programming
style and technique; style and commenting are consistent between code I
show students and solutions I craft for myself and for others in my
consulting.
