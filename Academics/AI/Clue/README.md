In my AI course we run a semester-long project to develop a rule-based
Clue playing agent. My (close guarded) agent, implemented in Prolog, is
shown here.

Note that I have NOT attempted to optimize this code in any way. It is
written almost entirely in conjunctive form and makes little to no use
of optimizations such as the cut operator. In this state, the code is
easier to experiment with by adding and removing rules that affect the
game-play of the agent.
